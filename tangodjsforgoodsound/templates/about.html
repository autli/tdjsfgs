<h1>Our mission</h1>

<p class="margin-bottom">
  Out of respect to the Tango Music, the musicians, the orchestras and
  the cultural heritage of Buenos Aires and Montevideo it is a matter
  of concern to us to play this music as close as possible to the
  original recordings.

<p class="margin-bottom">
  We are two Tango-DJs located in Switzerland aiming for a good sound
  in milongas.

<p class="margin-none">
  By creating this website we hope to bring together DJs and milonga
  organizers who share this aim:
  <ul>
    <li>DJs have the opportunity to share or explain their instruments, equipment and ideas.
    <li>Beginning and advanced DJs find inspiration to improve their work concerning sound quality.
    <li>Milonga organizers find support in locating DJs who provide good sound.
  </ul>

<p class="margin-bottom">
<p>
  We trust in our DJ-colleagues' honesty and accuracy concerning data
  entry. We do not assume responsibility for their statements.
