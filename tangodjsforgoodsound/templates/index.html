<h1>We provide good sound!</h1>
<p class="margin-bottom">
  Out of respect for the Tango Music, the musicians, the orchestras and
  the cultural heritage of Buenos Aires and Montevideo it is a matter
  of concern to us to play this music as closely as possible to the
  original recordings.

<p class="margin-bottom">
  We search for the best transfers of the original recordings and use
  good quality audio tools and software (interfaces, sound cards,
  DACs, sound processors) for performing them.

<p class="margin-bottom">
  DJs sharing our ideas are invited to join us.

<p class="margin-bottom">
  Organizers and dancers may select DJs and enjoy the sound of the music.

<p class="margin-bottom">
  As for now, there are {{ djList|length }} DJs on the list giving
  detailed information on their setup.

{% if djList %}
<h2>Registered DJs:</h2>
<table id="index">
{% for dj in djList %}
<tr>
  <td><a href="/{{ dj.id }}/">{{ dj.name|truncatechars:28 }}</a></td>
  <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
  {% if dj.province.strip %}
    <td>{{ dj.country.name }}, {{ dj.province|truncatechars:20 }}</td>
  {% else %}
    <td>{{ dj.country.name }}</td>
